Hi,

This is a reminder that for the ghostbusters problem in HW3 I am expecting you to read the inputs from the provided input files. You can either take the file as an argument to your program or read the file from standard in.

If you have already submitted your project and didnâ€™t read the inputs from the sample files, please change your code to read the supplied files one at a time and resubmit your code. Remember, you need to supply directions on how to execute your code from the command line.
