 1.   Instructions

    Submissions:

    For each problem submit your commented code, a readme.txt describing your solution, the heart of your algorithm and directions to run your submission.

    e.g. python mysubmission.py < inputfile.txt

    Zip up your submission and name your file <yourlastname>_HW3.<zip extension>

    e.g. mellor_HW3.zip


    Note: it may be easier to submit your code in separate files one file for each question.


    I will post sample inputfiles with the correct answers shortly
