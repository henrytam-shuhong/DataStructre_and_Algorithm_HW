## How to run the code:
```terminal
 python3 problem3.py <rightangles_1.txt

```

## description
- read the input file and creat a matrix for coordinates
- traverse every point and build up coordinates based on it
- calculate the new  coordinates of other points and the angles of each point in the polar coordinates
- sort the points in regard to the angles in the new array
- traverse the new array and search for the complementary points which form a right angle together with the origin as the right angel vertex.
- conclude the total number of right triangles
